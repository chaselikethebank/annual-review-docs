## Positive Funnel
When something is creating positive cash flow.

## Neutral Funnel
Funnel that is neither making nor losing money.

## Negative Funnel
Funnel that loses capital.

### Examples of:

Running an ad campaign that returns more money than is put into the ad is a positive funnel. When this happens, you have a money-printing machine. Add more money into the ads, produce more return at the bottom of the funnel.

When you successfully build a positive funnel, you scale it up slowly.

Eventually, you will reach a threshold of some other variable that will begin to exhaust and your funnel will move towards neutrality and eventually negative.

### Examples of variables that will be eroded in time:
- Selling out of your product (physical)
- TAM (total addressable market), you exhaust your niche => nobody left to sell to
- Trends change
- A competitor enters the market driving up the cost of your ads

### Case Study:

I built a funnel for a single and its B-side on a 7’’ square.
- Target demo: 18-34, living in the cities routed for the next tour, fans of I can’t remember
- Cost: can’t remember
- Results: Sold out of records, ordered another batch, sold out of records, ordered another batch, sold out => eventually had new music to focus on and chalked it up as a win.

### Why do negative funnels work?

Well, they technically don’t. But they can work through time.<br/>
Negative funnels that never create income are called, “out of business”.<br/>
When to use a negative funnel? When your funnel is gaining some kind of market share, aka building your audience/team/infrastructure/tools. <br/>
Audience, team, infrastructure, tools—all of these resources can be instruments to leverage other resources that create positive cash flow.<br/>
For these reasons, negative sales funnels can work, eventually. <br/>


### Negative Funnel
Let’s look at ad spend on a record and how it might be a negative funnel but can create leverage in some other areas.

Funnels - always remember to work backwards from a desirable result.
“How can we make $2k/20K/200K from Spotify?”

$10K ad spend annually (have to be good at ads though!)

#### Results:
**Year 1**
- 50K monthly listeners (+/- 150K streams monthly)
- Spotify pays out $8.1K ($4.5K / M)
- Net: -$1.9K

**Year 2**
- 25K monthly listeners (+/- 150K streams monthly)
- Spotify pays out $4.05K
- Net: +$2.15K

Now, what would happen if we moved the $10K ad spend up to $100K?

In this model, we would produce $21.5K of positive cash flow.

$1M? +$215K

Funnels are great!

Stepping back… Yes, there are a lot of other expenses (the cost of the person writing and managing the copy of the a/b split tests through an entire year + + +), but this shows how a negative sales funnel can* produce income EVENTUALLY if the equity is aggregating in the right place.

### What else are examples of negative funnels?
- Loss leaders in retail, think Walmart
- Freemium models in software, think Gmail
- New market penetration pricing, think Uber and Lyft

## What are Neutral Funnels and When to Use Them?
Neutral funnels can transmute capital resources to another resource but they can also be used as a moat to keep the market too expensive for incumbents.

A Coca-Cola Super Bowl commercial vs. a new soda’s Super Bowl commercial will have different results in sales.

Coca-Cola may not be able to even recognize any sales or lack thereof due to a Super Bowl advert. But* the opposite is true for a new entrant.

### How does this work in music?
If there is a good gig, say a festival or convention, and the offer is for top billing, and the schedule works great but maybe the compensation isn’t exactly a high watermark. It might be worth it to simply keep another act/group/artist from gaining any market share.

### What are some other ways to transmute capital to leverage negative funnels into positive cash returns that are outside of say ads?
Earned media!

Earned media is great, but it is very competitive. Let’s build a funnel with earned media being our main function to leverage live events.
