# Funnels

Wait a min, what is a funnel again? 


I say 'Funnels', and admitidly, I use it a few different ways. What do I mean? 

## Sales Funnels 
Let's start w a **Sales Funnel**: 

1000 people view a post / read the sales copy

250 engage (like, comment, share)

50 click into and get to the sales page 

20 people make a purchase

Funnels are a great way to work backwards from a solution with clear delineations for resource allocation, internal/external control (mechanics and who owns them) to a starting point. 

Using the sales funnel ...

**Set the goal**: 100 sales / week 

Using the sales funnel 1000 : 20 means 5000 impressions a week (paid, or organic ) would yeild your goal of 100 sales. 

More on sales funnel soon here in a bit.
