# Building things is tough

It is super tough to build anything in the music industry as there are so many things at play. 


## Perspective 

A music business system has how many sides / departments / directions? <br/>

3 Sides<br/>

Public facing <br/>
Client facing <br/>
Industry facing <br/>

You have to build each side, one at a time, and in relationship or you loose your balance. 

## Public facing

This one is easy. This is what everyone thinks about when they think about music business. People consuming the works. <br/>
It might look like (and is often quantitative - number based):<br/> 
- Streams
- Ticketing
- Social

## Client Facing 

This part tends to be for the 'HEADS', but is super important as a value add for the best talent. 

<br/>
In this scenario a "Client" is talent (artist, producer, designer) - the top of the stack that the public will consume. 

```
Artist: "We should play Carnegie Hall!"
Other: "Why?"
Artist: "Becuase The Beatles played there!"
```
It is massively important to build your value and association as a ... "Carnegie Hall". <br/>
You want the talent outside of your system to say, "I want to work with them because only the best talent of a generation play at, Carnegie Hall!"
<br/>

## Industry Facing 

There are movers and shakers. There are people who solve problems for themselves and others. There are people in places that get things done. 
```
Be known as a system of resolution
```
The brand you build among your peers (industry people) is exceptionally valuable. Partner and partner well. All systems have strengths and weaknesses. You will find successful partnerships with the thing you have is what they need and the thing you need is what you have. 

## Diving into Sync

### Let's look at Sync as an example of value / brand from the perspective of industry facing

Sync is the single greatest ROI in music. <br/>
Partnering w a Sync house is exceptionally important for success. 
You can either build it (long - super hard way, more $) or you can partner (faster - still hard, less $). <br/>
```
How do we find a sync partner?
```

Reverse engineer with this question: 
```
What do sync houses need? 
```

### Even still

If you continue reverse engineering you can continue to stack the wins. 

<br/>
Ask this question:
```
What do music supervisors need sync houses?
```

A sync house might ask: 
```
What does a music supervisor need from us?
```
Even more...
```
What does a day in a life look like as a music supervisor?
```

## Thought Experiment: Music Supervisor Workload

A single music supervisor is responsible:

- **Shows per Quarter**: ~10 shows  
- **Episodes per Show**: ~8 episodes  
- **Sync Placements per Episode**: ~10 placements  
- **Communication per Placement**: ~10 emails and 1 contract 
- **Budgent per Episode**:  ~$150,000

### Quarterly Breakdown

| Category            | Quantity                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Total Shows**     | 10                                 |
| **Total Episodes**  | 100 (10 shows × 8 episodes)       |
| **Total Placements**| 1,000 (100 episodes × 10)         |
| **Total Emails**    | 10,000 (1,000 placements × 10)    |
| **Total Contracts** | 1,000 (1 per placement)           |
| **Total $ Decisions** | $15,000,000                     |

 

### Budget Estimate

If each show has an approximate budget of **$150,000**, this amount would scale accordingly across episodes and placements.

### Boiling up

So, what can I do as a music rights manager / label to make it easier for a music supervisor and in tern my sync partner? 

- Carte Blanche control, not just "Access" 
- Large Catalogs or why bother (controlling 10 songs < controlling 100 songs) 
- Genre Specific (a label that covers a wide surface area causes friction and dissolves brand ID both for the label and the sync partner's partners)
- Well documented (indie, female vox, 85bpm) becuase that is how requests come to them - so that is their mental model / way of organizing in their mind
- The ability to say "Yes" before consulting - Move fast and beat others to the starting line
- Batch Batch Batch 

NOW THAT IS HOW YOU GET SYNCS!


### Circling back 

Now, and I hope you can appreciate, if you do these things and build your system with these values / trade offs in mind, you can: 

```
Be known as a system of resolution
```

this is what I mean when I say, 'Industry facing'
