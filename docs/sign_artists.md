# Sign Artists



When you have great systems working in your favor and inside of a budget (positive ROI) you HAVE TO push more artists through the system. 


## Network 

Network and discover talented musicians that align with the vision.  

I like these two questions as a function funnels to help if I should or shouldn't bring a person/group into the world/work: 
- Are they talented? 
- Are the easy to work with? 

If both, yes, I bring them in.

Often, this will take time. + It should move from small projects to larger ones. There is some value building rapport/vocabulary/strengths/roles while working in low stakes small projects (think joint post, single show, etc) that can be leveraged and trusted in larger projects (think press campaigns, album cycles, or contracts). 



## The Right People

How to build a future where you have the right people in your network? 

```
See something, say something - NYPD, Subway Marketing
```

When you see someone doing something of value, when something pops out of the texture and you appreciate let them know! Could be... voice, design, production, copy, phrasing, organization, ... anything ... Reach out, and let them know what you appreciate about what they are doing and I would even say tell them to make a note that you recognize it and propose a notion of future collaboration. 

```
Game Recognize Game
```
The idea is that they will associate that your values and priciples align to their unique and assymetric skill sets. Game recognize game! By proposing colaboration, you will hopefully be top of mind for the next thing they are excited about articulating that particular resourece. 

### What does that look like? 

- Scroll instagram
- Turn the filter on 
- Find principle allignment (your values line up w their work)
- Express sentiment
- Proposed collab
- Inquire about directionaly (what they are excited about next)
- Find project allignment (your projects line up w their excitement) or Repeat until 
- Collaborate
