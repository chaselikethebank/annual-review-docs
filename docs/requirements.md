# Performance Review App Requirements

## Problem Definition
The organization requires a centralized web application for managing end-of-year performance reviews. This app will allow managers and employees to interact with job-specific review guides, send automated email notifications, complete review forms dynamically, and view a dashboard summarizing all performance data. The app must prioritize rapid development and ease of use, leveraging SQLite for cost-effectiveness and Laravel/Blade for an optimized developer experience.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### User Management
- Authentication system for employees, managers, and admins.
- Role-based permissions to control access (admin, manager, employee).

#### Content Management
- CRUD operations for job review guides.
- Assign job review guides to specific departments or employees.
- Dynamically link guides to forms based on user roles and departments.

#### Form Handling
- Generate review forms dynamically based on assigned job review guides.
- Allow managers to fill forms for employees.
- Allow employees to fill self-review and manager-review forms.
- Store completed forms for reporting and auditing.

#### Email Notifications
- Configurable email templates for notifications (reminders, completions, deadlines).
- Trigger email notifications on specific events (form assignment, deadline approaching, submission).
- Full CRUD operations for email templates.

#### Dashboard and Reporting
- Dashboard displaying summarized performance metrics.
- Highlight flagged scores (below 70%, above 95%) with configurable thresholds.
- Drill-down functionality to view individual review details.
- Summarize data in matrix format (e.g., scores by department/employee).

#### Data Integrity and Export
- Export completed review data (CSV, PDF).
- Audit logs for admin actions (form creation, deletions).

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- The application must handle up to 500 simultaneous users without performance degradation.
- Use SQLite for low-cost, lightweight data storage.

#### Usability
- Simple, intuitive UI for employees, managers, and admins.
- Accessibility features for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

#### Security
- Secure authentication and role-based access control.
- Encrypted data storage and secure communication (TLS).

#### Scalability
- Modular architecture to enable future migration to a more robust database (e.g., MySQL).
- Easy integration of additional features such as API endpoints.

#### Deployment
- Single-server deployment with SQLite.
- Support for running on shared hosting or local servers.

## Scope Management
- Clearly define the scope to include only the features outlined above.
- Avoid feature creep by documenting additional requests for future versions.
- Establish checkpoints to review progress and ensure adherence to scope.

## Sign-Off Process
1. Initial "back-of-the-envelope" ideas agreed upon by all stakeholders.
2. Develop rough sketches (e.g., Excalidraw) for UI concepts.
3. Create comprehensive Figma designs for approval.
4. Write code only after final approval of designs and features.

## Developer Reminders
- Approach iterations with a utilitarian mindset: prioritize the projectâ€™s success over individual preferences.
- Revisit requirements iteratively for refinement and alignment with project goals.
- Maintain flexibility and a collaborative attitude during changes or pivots.
