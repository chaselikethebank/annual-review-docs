# Workflow

1. **Admin creates a Review** → (User, Job Role, Guide, and Term are bundled)  
2. **User receives an email** with a link to their Dashboard  
3. **User sees "My Reviews"** → Each Review has a status (Incomplete, In Progress, Completed)  
4. **User clicks "Begin Assessment"** → Chooses a Review Perspective (Self, Peer, Manager, Subordinate)  
5. **System checks** if the user has subordinates or is a manager → Renders valid options  
6. **User starts the Assessment** → Answers questions based on the selected perspective  
7. **User submits the Assessment** → Status updates in My Reviews  

This keeps **"Review"** for administrative tracking and **"Assessment"** for the user-driven evaluation process.
