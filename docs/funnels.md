 
## More perspectives on funnels!


```
Don't get caught in other people's funnels! - George Hotz
```

**Funnel** Is a helpful metaphor for the pathways businesses navigate as they work towards their goals. When a business finds itself "caught in someone else's funnel," it often means they are still discovering their own unique path and vision. This can happen to anyone, and it's a natural part of growth. 

- **Exploration and Learning**: Relying on external systems can provide valuable insights and experiences, allowing businesses to learn what works best for them.
- **Opportunity for Growth**: Recognizing this reliance is the first step toward empowerment. It opens up the opportunity to build your own systems that align with your goals.
- **Resource Management**: While working with others can sometimes feel limiting, itâ€™s also a chance to focus on your strengths and create a solid foundation for future success.

By taking the time to understand and develop your own funnels, you can harness your potential, make informed decisions, and ultimately thrive in your unique journey. 

## Vertical Integration => New Opportunities => Confidence

```
When you catch yourself in a funnel, get out and build your own. 
```
Viewed through a different perspective, think **Vertical Integration**. 

Traditionally, most industries find margin ($) in vertical integration. This helps them find wins. This is especially true in music. 

**What does vertical integration mean exactly?** 
Here's an example: 
``` 
An oil company finds its greatest expense is shipping costs. 
So, they integrate vertically, buy purchasing shipping companies. 
```
Move up and down the stack. Eliminate paying premiemums by bringing those systems in house.

### Next Steps 

So you have figured out royalty accounting, press, booking tours, mixing records... ? Great! Offer those solutions to others. Yes, that sounds crazy and hipocritical, (don't get caught in other people's funnels, but build funnels for others!) **but** you will find you are only good at a handful of things. For example, yes, it might make sense to try and figure out how to manage royalties and payouts in house, and if you do, offer it up, if you fail, all good, outsource it (and now with confidence). 

## Vision 

A reminder about vision. What is your vision? Not to be some associated with some # on a screen but to build a system that can produce #s on a screen and inside of a budget. How do you become a person that builds that system? The more of the work you are directly responsible for, the less luck will play in your success, and the more repeatable it is.

## Extra 
```
The money you save by living outside of someone else's funnel 
is equal to the money you donâ€™t need to earn for a return on investment.
