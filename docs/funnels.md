## Funnels

Build funnels and systems that rely as little as possible on other funnels. 

When you see you are part of another funnel, build it. 

Viewed through a different perspective, vertical integration. 

Move up and down the stack of the music industry eliminating those who you are paying premiemums outside of your system. 

Don't get caught in other people's funnels!
