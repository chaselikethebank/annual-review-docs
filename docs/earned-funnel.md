### How to create $10K/$100K in live compensation?
Say, a publicist takes on a record for 6 months active and 1 year touring support @ $10K.

Over the campaign, they get 10+/- national earned media placements.

Now, let's go book some shows! (this is a huge function of funnels - How to book 10 gigs annually?)

Event promoters care about ticket sales. They make speculative decisions on the brand of an act, qualitative (words - earned media) and quantitative (numbers - previous ticket sales, streams, socials), to allocate reasonable compensation for said act.

Inquire about a booking, deliver the good news (in this case, the 10 earned media placements aka ‘pull quotes’) and place a guarantee of +/-$3K.

After $1.5K expenses, 10 gigs through the year, $15K positive cash flow.

What would happen if you got more/less media? Guaranteed more/less $? Booked more/less gigs?

Funnels are great.
