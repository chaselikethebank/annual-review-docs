## Hosting

You can publish or host your docs site when you're done to different platforms like: [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), etc.

First, run the build command

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

This should create a new dist folder that contains all the static files of your docs. In your hosting service, add these commands to their respective fields.
Build command: npm run docs:build
Output directory: docs/.vitepress/dist

This should create a new `dist` folder that contains all the static files of your docs. In your hosting service, add these commands to their respective fields.
